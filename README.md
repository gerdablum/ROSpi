Autonomous control via sensors and control of the individual wheels.
Keyboard control was already used as the basis for the control.
This was extended in SS 17 by a ToF sensor which measures distances. 
In WS 17/18, a second TOF and a third ultrasound sensor was added and controlled via I2C Bus. 
The vehicle can drive autonomous now, detect obstacles and absysses.
